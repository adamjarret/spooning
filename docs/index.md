spooning aims to provide a radically simple way of defining unit tests in JavaScript.

 - _easy_  — no test-specific syntax to learn
 - _flexible_ — define tests with Promises, callbacks, or synchronously
 - _fast_ — optionally run tests in parallel
 - _lean_ — only production dependency is [async][async]
 - _compatible_ — plays nicely with [Travis CI][travis] and [nyc][nyc]
 - _modern_ — written in ES2015 (aka ES6), supports node 6 and later
 - _open source_ — [MIT licensed][license] and [available on GitHub][repo]
